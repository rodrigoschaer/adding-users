# Creating a List of Users

## ðŸ’® Project Features

This project was written mainly in typescript and SaSS, with the intention to practice basic react skills, such as: event handling, bottom-up component communications and error modals handling.

## How it looks

The UI is pretty simple. It only has a Form and a list, both wrapped in separate card components.

If the user does not complete the form properly, the error will be displayed. The error message can be discarded by clicking the Ok button or in the card's backdrop.
